Cert-Reorder
============

A python script to re-order the certificates in a pen formatted file.  One of the applications we run requires that the certificates be in a particular order (server, intermediate, CA) and our CA provided the certificates in the opposite order (CA, intermediate, server) so I wrote this script to correct the ordering.
